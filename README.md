# DnD_combat_statistics
This is a project where i collect and analyze combat statistics from my two Dnd campaigns. It was started in 2021 but is now been abandoned since the campaign ended for completion. it was done 100% in excel where data was inputed manualy during the play. The relevent datapoints are extracted using pivot table then formated and displayed in a dashboard.

### Completed dashboard for campaign: othercide
